## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require label84/php-nederland-postcode
```

## Usage

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Label84\NederlandPostcode\NederlandPostcodeClient;

$client = new NederlandPostcodeClient(
    key: 'npa_live_XXX',
);

try {
    $address = $client->find(
        postcode: '1118BN',
        number: 800,
        addition: ['coordinates'],
    );
} catch (NederlandPostcodeException $exception) {
    // handle exception
}

echo $address->street; // Schiphol Boulevard
echo $address->coordinates->latitude; // 52.30703569036619
```

### Address Endpoint

The address endpoint allows you to fetch address information from the Nederland Postcode API.

You can find addresses using either the `find` method for a single address or the `list` method for multiple addresses. When you provide only the `postcode`, the `list` method will return all addresses associated with that postcode.

The following optional attributes can be requested to be included in the response:

- `coordinates`: Includes latitude and longitude of the address.

#### Single Address

To fetch a single address for a given postcode and house number, you can use the `find` method.

The `postcode` and `number` parameters are required to fetch a single address.

```php
use Label84\NederlandPostcode\NederlandPostcodeClient;

$client = new NederlandPostcodeClient(
    key: 'npa_live_XXX'
);

$address = $client->find(
    postcode: '1118BN',
    number: 800,
    addition: null,
    attributes: ['coordinates']
);
```

This will return an `Address` object like this:

```php
Address {
    postcode: "1118BN",
    number: 800,
    street: "Schiphol Boulevard",
    city: "Schiphol",
    municipality: "Haarlemmermeer",
    province: "Noord-Holland",
    coordinates: Coordinates {
        latitude: 52.30528553688755,
        longitude: 4.750645160863609
    }
}
```

When no address is found for the given postcode and number, an `AddressNotFoundException` is thrown. If multiple addresses are found, a `MultipleAddressesFoundException` is thrown.

#### Multiple Addresses

To fetch multiple addresses for a given postcode, you can use the `list` method.

The `postcode` parameter is required. The `number` and `addition` parameters are optional.

```php
use Label84\NederlandPostcode\NederlandPostcodeClient;

$client = new NederlandPostcodeClient(
    key: 'npa_live_XXX'
);

$address = $client->list(
    postcode: '1118BN',
    number: null,
    addition: null,
    attributes: ['coordinates']
);
```

This will return an `AddressCollection` object like this:

```php
AddressCollection {
    items: [
        Address {
            postcode: "1118BN",
            number: 701,
            street: "Schiphol Boulevard",
            city: "Schiphol",
            municipality: "Haarlemmermeer",
            province: "Noord-Holland",
            coordinates: Coordinates {
                latitude: 52.30703569036619,
                longitude: 4.755174782205992
            }
        },
        Address {
            postcode: "1118BN",
            number: 800,
            street: "Schiphol Boulevard",
            city: "Schiphol",
            municipality: "Haarlemmermeer",
            province: "Noord-Holland",
            coordinates: Coordinates {
                latitude: 52.30528553688755,
                longitude: 4.750645160863609
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Quota Endpoint

The quota endpoint allows you to check your current API usage and limits. This endpoint does not increment your usage count.

> [!NOTE]
> Values may lag behind the actual usage. They’re cached for up to five minutes, so the `used` and `limit` numbers might not be fully up-to-date.

```php
use Label84\NederlandPostcode\NederlandPostcodeClient;

$client = new NederlandPostcodeClient(
    key: 'npa_live_XXX'
);

$quota = $client->usage();
```

This will return an `Quota` object like this:

```php
Quota {
    used: 1500,
    limit: 10000,
}
```

## Error Handling

The package throws a `NederlandPostcodeException` for any errors encountered during the API request. You can catch this exception to handle errors gracefully:

```php
use Label84\NederlandPostcode\Exceptions\NederlandPostcodeException;

$client = new NederlandPostcodeClient(
    key: 'npa_live_XXX'
);

try {
    $addresses = $client->find(
        postcode: 'INVALID',
        number: 123,
        addition: null,
    );
} catch (NederlandPostcodeException $exception) {
    // handle error
}
```

When calling the `find` method, if no address is found, an `AddressNotFoundException` is thrown. If multiple addresses are found, a `MultipleAddressesFoundException` is thrown.

When a network or HTTP error occurs during the API request, a `NederlandPostcodeRequestException` is thrown, which wraps the original `RequestException`.
